	/**
	•	REVIEW Assignment for CS176
	•	Create a class called CashRegister.
	•	CashRegister will use two instance variables:
	purchase (double) will be a total of all purchases made by the customer
	payment (double) will be the amount the customer is submitting to pay for purchases.
	•	CashRegister methods:
	o	Constructor will create a cash register with purchase = 0 and payment = 0.
	o	recordPurchase will record a sale and add the new sale amount to purchase
	o	receivePayment will receive the amount paid by the customer into payment
	o	giveChange will calculate and return the amount of change due to the customer (purchase – payment)
	•	Create a tester called CashRegisterTester which will:
	o	Create a CashRegister object
	o	Use a loop to accept purchases from the screen until a SENTINEL value of -1 is typed
	o	Accept the payment for the purchases
	o	Calculate and print the amount of change due to the customer
	•	Document all components of the CashRegister class
	•	Run CashRegisterTester several times to achieve the results shown below
